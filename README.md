# Quantum Computing & Mechanics Studies

Repository for exercises and numerical simulations focused on Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing Fundamentals.

## 📋 Description

This project contains Python scripts for the visualization and calculation of quantum phenomena, based on the theoretical formalism of Landau & Lifshitz.

## 🧮 Contents

### 1. Physics Fundamentals (Lesson 1)

- **Black Body Radiation:** Implementation of Planck's Law for different temperatures.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Visualization of the Energy-Time relation ($\Delta E \Delta t \geq \hbar$).
- **Dimensional Analysis:** Scripts for unit conversion between systems (Ergs, Joules, eV).
